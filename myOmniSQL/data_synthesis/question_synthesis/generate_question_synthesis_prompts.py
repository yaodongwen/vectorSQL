style2desc = {
"Formal": '''**Formal Style**
   - Uses standard grammar and vocabulary.
   - Example: Find all students older than 18 years and return their home addresses.
   - Vector Example: Find the three articles most closely related to Stable Diffusion and return them.''',

"Colloquial": '''**Colloquial Style**
   - Employs informal vocabulary and expressions.
   - Example: Hey! Could you help me find all the students who are over 18? I'd love to know their names and where they live.
   - Vector Example: Hey there! Can you grab me the top 3 articles that are most closely related to Stable Diffusion?''',

"Imperative": '''**Imperative Style**
   - Uses command or directive sentences.
   - Example: Could you please gather all the students who are older than 18? I really need to know their names and where they live!
   - Vector Example: Please find the three articles most closely related to Stable Diffusion and return their name.''',

"Interrogative": '''**Interrogative Style**
   - Uses question forms.
   - Example: Could you tell me which students are older than 18 and what their home addresses are?
   - Vector Example: Could you show me the 3 articles that most have to do with Stable Diffusion?''',

"Descriptive": '''**Descriptive Style**
   - Uses detailed descriptions with contextual information.
   - Example: I want to know the names and home addresses of all students older than 18.
   - Vector Example: I need to find articles that most closely related to Stable Diffusion, returning the top 3 matches sorted by cosine similarity.''',

"Concise": '''**Concise Style**
   - Use short sentences.
   - Example: Students older than 18, return their names and addresses.
   - Vector Example: Top 3 related articles to Stable Diffusion.''',

"Vague": '''**Vague Style**
   - Includes ambiguous vocabulary requiring inference.
   - Example: What are the names and addresses of those older students? (External Knowledge: 'older students' refers to age >= 18.)
   - Vector Example: Find a few articles have to do with Stable Diffusion. (External Knowledge: 'a few' refers to vector similarity search with k=3 limit)''',

"Metaphorical": '''**Metaphorical Style**
   - Uses metaphors or metaphorical expressions.
   - Example: Find the names and addresses of those who have reached adulthood. (External Knowledge: 'reached adulthood' refers to age >= 18.)
   - Vector Example: Find a few articles have to do with SD in ai. (External Knowledge: 'SD in ai' refers to Stable Diffusion)''',

"Multi-turn Dialogue": '''**Multi-turn Dialogue Style**
    - This involves a dialogue to clarify the user's query needs.
    - Example: [{"User": "I want to query some student information."}, {"Assistant": "Which students' information would you like to query?"}, {"User": "Students older than 18."}, {"Assistant": "What other information would you like to know about them?"}, {"User": "Names and addresses."}, {"Assistant": "Is there anything else you need?"}, {"User": "No."}, {"Assistant": "OK, I will help you translate your request into an SQL query."}]
    - Vector Example: 
      User: "I'm looking for some articles."
      Assistant: "How many articles would you like to find and What field of paper are you looking for?"
      User: "About 3, and they are related to Stable Diffusion."
      Assistant: "I'll search for 3 articles that most closely related to Stable Diffusion."'''

   - "k=N" specifies the number of similar items to return;
   - Vectors are compared using Euclidean distance (L2 norm) by default;
   - Similarity increases as distance decreases;
   - Include any domain-specific knowledge about the vector meaning.'''
